<p>I have an <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> and love it, except for the fact that it&rsquo;s very user friendly. What do I mean? I&rsquo;m more of a technical user with computers. The fact that the <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> is so easy to use, makes it hard to do slightly more technical stuff. Some trivial email things that frustrate me:</p>
<ul><li><strike>No Custom Email Signatures per Account</strike> <img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneTaskSync" title="iPhone Signatures">Solved!</a></li>
<li><strike>No integrated Exchange Task Sync</strike> <span><img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /></span> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneTaskSync" title="iPhone Task Sync" target="_self">Solved!</a></li>
<li><strike>Inability to Send As another email account, on the fly.</strike> <span><img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /></span> Solved!</li>
</ul><p>Well, I&rsquo;ve finally found the solution for the last option. I&rsquo;ve been digging around the internet for a while and read some things that led me to the right solution. I was able to get my IMAP configured to send as any of the many email accounts that I dump into that account. This is fantastic because (among other things) I&rsquo;m a student at <a href="http://unt.edu/">UNT</a>. When I reply to my Student related emails, I do not necessarily want my Teachers to have my personal email address. Now, I can reply from my <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> with confidence. Hope this helps you all out as much as it has helped me out! Cheers!<!-- more --></p>
<h2>Configuring Send As for iPhone IMAP accounts</h2>
<p><span><em>Note: This DOES include <a href="http://mail.google.com/">GMail</a>, since that&rsquo;s actually the service I&rsquo;m IMAP'ing to.</em></span></p>
<h2><span>From your iPhone:</span></h2>
<div><ol><li><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1385">Configure your IMAP Account</a><br /><em>Note: There&rsquo;s <a href="http://tinyurl.com/355edca">plenty of help online</a> with this, so I&rsquo;ll focus on the task at hand. The rest of this instruction set assumes that your IMAP account is configured. These instructions are NOT guaranteed or even likely to work in any account (i.e.: POP, Gmail IMAP), except an IMAP account. The settings are slightly different in each. The funny thing is, <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=77702">even GMail suggests that you use regular IMAP setting when you are configuring your iPhone or iPod Touch to connect to a GMail account.</a></em></li>
<li>Go to: <em>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars</em></li>
<li>Select your IMAP account to edit your IMAP settings, as shown:<br /><div>
