<p>I have previously posted about how I have an <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> and love it, except for the fact that it&rsquo;s very user friendly. What do I mean? I&rsquo;m more of a technical user. The fact that the <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> is so easy to use, makes it hard to do slightly more technical stuff. Some trivial email things that frustrate me:</p>
<ul><li><strike>No Custom Email Signatures per Account</strike> <img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /> Solved!</li>
<li><strike>No integrated Exchange Task Sync</strike> <img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneTaskSync" title="iPhone Task Sync">Solved!</a></li>
<li><strike>Inability to Send As another email account, on the fly.</strike> <img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneSendAs" title="iPhone Send As" target="_self">Solved!</a></li>
</ul><p>I <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneSendAs" title='iPhone Mail "Send As" Settings'>previously</a> blogged about how iOS didn&rsquo;t allow custom signatures per e-mail account. Seems that it only took Apple 7 major revisions of their OS to include this as a feature.<!-- more -->It came up as a topic cause I&rsquo;m still using an iPhone 4 (which was a gift) running iOS 6.  Told my friend I wouldn&rsquo;t buy another iOS device and cited this issue as a humerus reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If iOS could give me a signature line per account, I wouldn&rsquo;t need to switch to Android,&rdquo; I said.</p>
