# TokBox - Free Video Conferencing

UPDATE: [Breaking up is hard to do …](http://www.tokbox.com/blog/?p=1701)

I spent quite a while scouring the internet looking for a free Video Conferencing (3+ connections) solution. After several headaches and failed projects, I asked some co-workers and one of them pointed me to [TokBox](http://www.tokbox.com).

[TokBox](http://www.tokbox.com) is the simplest, most engaging way for you to connect face-to-face with up to twenty of your colleagues, customers or friends at once. Video chatting with up to 20 people at once is FREE. If you need more from your video chat, check out their premium features. You’ll only ever pay for the premium features you use. They’re fair like that. I felt I owed them a post since they are now my video conferencing solution of choice. I hope others stumble across this and find the information to be useful.
