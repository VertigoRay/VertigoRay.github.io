<p>I was doing some PowerShelling and needed a <a href="http://bit.ly/zYbS5T" title="Pause">Pause</a> command.  Unfortunately, the command isn’t native to PowerShell.  Using a TechNet Tip of the Week article as a starting point, I devised my solution.</p>

<p>Hope it helps others out there.  Just add the function to your PowerShell Profile or as a Functions in a script to make it available!</p>
