Project B will be a continuation of [Project A](/2018/06/11/project-1a-description).
In Project A, I created a virtual lab that would allow us to train our colleagues without risking production systems.
I made an asynchronous training process to allow a colleague to train at their own pace.
They learned how to manage AD users, AD groups, and network file shares.
The next step of this will be to create synchronous training for both remedial training and for training our part-time technicians.

In this training, we will teach the basics of all of the components that were previously covered.
This will give a new person a path to the more advanced training taught in Project A.
The goal of this training is primarily to train part-time technicians to do some of the tasks that consume the full-timer's day.
This will free up the full-timer to work on more innovative work and advance him or herself.
