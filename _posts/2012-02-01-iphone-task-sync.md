<p>Most people are aware of this by now, but I thought I&rsquo;d post a quick follow-up to a <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneSendAs" title="iPhone Send As" target="_self">previous post of mine</a> &hellip;</p>
<p>I have an <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> and love it, except for the fact that it&rsquo;s very user friendly. What do I mean? I&rsquo;m more of a technical user. The fact that the <a href="http://iphone.com/">iPhone</a> is so easy to use, makes it hard to do slightly more technical stuff. Some trivial email things that frustrate me:</p>
<ul><li><strike>No Custom Email Signatures per Account</strike> <img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneSigs" title="iPhone Signatures per Account">Solved!</a></li>
<li><strike>No integrated Exchange Task Sync</strike> <span><img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /></span> Solved!</li>
<li><strike>Inability to Send As another email account, on the fly.</strike> <span><img alt="success" height="14" src="http://i.imgur.com/kGWKL.png" width="16" /></span> <a href="http://go.vertigion.com/iPhoneSendAs" title="iPhone Send As" target="_self">Solved!</a></li>
</ul><div><!-- more -->The second issue has been solved by Apple with iOS 5.  They simply call it <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#reminders" title="Reminders" target="_blank">Reminders</a> instead of Tasks.  When setting up your Exchange connection to your company or Gmail, simply turn Reminders, as shown:</div>

<p>I know this was a quick write-up, but I felt it was overdue and required for thoroughness.</p>
