<p>Gmail has a feature that lets you <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;ctx=mail&amp;answer=22370">send messages from other addresses</a>. &ldquo;Gmail&rsquo;s custom &lsquo;From:&rsquo; feature lets you use Gmail to send messages with another of your email addresses listed as the sender in place of your Gmail address. This way, it&rsquo;s easier to manage multiple accounts from the Gmail interface.&rdquo;<br /><br />A small inconvenience is that Google needs to include your primary email address in the headers and some mail clients inform users that the message is sent &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; a different address. Outlook is the biggest offender, especially for business messages sent from a a Gmail address &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; a custom domain.<!-- more --><br /><br /><a href="http://imgur.com/hd2Wu" title="on behalf of" target="_blank"><img alt="on behalf of" border="0" height="186" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364750680282268418" src="http://i.imgur.com/hd2Wu.gif" width="303" /></a><br />Some suggested that Gmail should stop including the primary email address in the headers, but that&rsquo;s a major faux pas, since Gmail needs to authenticate the messages sent using its SMTP servers. &ldquo;The reason we include your address in the headers at all is to help prevent your mail from being flagged as spam by your recipients&rsquo; email services. For those who want the technical details, we use the 'Sender&rsquo; field to be consistent with DomainKeys, a commonly used email authentication mechanism. If we didn&rsquo;t do this, your messages may get sent to your recipients&rsquo; spam folders, which would be worse than the annoyance the current implementation is causing,&rdquo; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-Message-Delivery-en/browse_thread/thread/f651cb1db5d9dd23/394ac4678b5e7be7">explains Google</a>.<br /><br />The solution for this problem is not very elegant, but Google implemented it: you&rsquo;ll need to send the messages using the email provider&rsquo;s SMTP servers. Go to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/accounts">Gmail&rsquo;s settings page</a>, select the Accounts tab, click on &ldquo;edit info&rdquo; next to the account you want to edit and then click on &ldquo;Save changes&rdquo;. For some reason, this doesn&rsquo;t work for Gmail addresses and Google doesn&rsquo;t make the changes behind the scenes.<br /><br /><a href="http://imgur.com/KQMxm" title="Gmail SMTP Example" target="_blank"><img alt="Gmail SMTP Example" border="0" height="379" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364739585207257874" src="http://i.imgur.com/KQMxm.png" width="497" /></a><br />&ldquo;We recognize that your other address might not have a server that you can use to send outbound messages â€” for example, if you use a forwarding alias rather than an actual mailbox, or if your other email provider doesn&rsquo;t support authenticated SMTP, or restricts access to specific IP ranges. For this reason, we&rsquo;ve kept the original method as well,&rdquo; <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/send-mail-from-another-address-without.html">mentions Gmail&rsquo;s blog</a>. The original method sends the messages using Gmail&rsquo;s SMTP servers.</p>
