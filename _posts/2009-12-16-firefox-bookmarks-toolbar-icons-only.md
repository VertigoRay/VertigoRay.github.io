# Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar: Icons Only

Ever want to get rid of the text next to the icons on your bookmarks toolbar in Firefox?

I was looking over a co-workers shoulder the other day and noticed that his bookmarks toolbar had no text next to the icons!!
I immediately got as giddy as school girl and demanded enlightenment.
He promptly responded me that I merely needed to needed to save the following code in a `userChrome.css` file:

```js
toolbar\[mode="icons"\] .toolbarbutton-text {
   display:none !important;
}
```

The file needs to be saved in: `*%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profile\s########.defaultchrome`

- ######## = 8 random numbers and letters. ie: h98nvfn5

Not sure where your *%AppData%* folder is? Try running the following from the Command Prompt: `echo %AppData%`

That should do it!
