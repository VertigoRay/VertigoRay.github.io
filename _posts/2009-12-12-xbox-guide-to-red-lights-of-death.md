# XBox Guide to Red Lights of Death

If there is a problem with the Xbox360 the LEDs in the ring of light will flash in a particular pattern. The pattern itself leads some insight to the problem. Certain patterns will lead to numbered error codes which will provide further insight to the problem. The numbered error codes are described below their corrosponding LED code.

Please contribute if you know of new codes that are not part of this list.

## Error Codes

### Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are flashing red

- The AV cable cannot be detected

#### Things to Try

- Make sure that the AV cable is correctly connected to the Xbox 360 console.
- Disconnect the AV cable from the Xbox 360 console, and then reconnect the AV cable to the Xbox 360 console.
- If the four flashing red lights continue to flash, try wiping the metal area of the AV pack with a dry cloth.
  - The metal area is the end that plugs into the console.
  - Wipe the metal area thoroughly, and then try the AV Pack again.
- If the AV cable is correctly connected but the four red lights are still flashing, substitute a different AV cable if you have one available.

### Sections 1, 3, and 4 are flashing red

- General Hardware Failure

Check the secondary Error Code per the instructions in the section below

#### Things to Try

Try restarting the console.
If restarting the console does not resolve the behavior, follow these steps:
Turn the console off.
Unplug all the power and AV cables from the console.
Unplug the power cord from the wall socket.
Firmly reconnect all the cables.
Turn on the console.
If these steps do not resolve the behavior, turn the console off, remove the hard drive, and then turn on the console. If the 3x Red LED error light is no longer displayed, turn the console off, re-attach the hard drive, and then turn on the console.
Also examine the lights on the power supply. When you turn on the console, the power supply light should illuminate green even if the three lights on the RoL flash red.

### Sections 1, and 3 are flashing red

- Overheating

#### Things to Try

Let the Xbox 360 console cool.

Note: You may have to wait several hours for the console to cool enough. Do not turn on the console when the console is hot.
Verify that the console has sufficient ventilation and that the fan is operating. For more information about ventilation, see the “More Information” section.

#### Prevention Suggestions

To try to prevent this problem, use the following precautions:

- Do not block any ventilation openings on the Xbox 360 console.
- Do not put the Xbox 360 console on a bed, on a sofa, or on any other soft surface that may block ventilation openings.
- Do not put the Xbox 360 console in a confined space, such as a bookcase, a rack, or a stereo cabinet, unless the space is well-ventilated.
- Do not put the Xbox 360 console near any heat source, such as a radiator, a heat register, a stove, or an amplifier.

**DO NOT EVER PUT YOUR CONSOLE IN THE FREEZER OR OUT IN COLD WEATHER**

Some people think that doing this might help “fix” an overheating console, in fact doing so could cause even bigger problems. Electronic devices like your console are made to function at and around room temperature, extreme cold temperatures can often cause just as many problems as extreme warm temperatures (such as overheating). Also if the console is located in a dramatically cold area while running, the difference in temperature between the hot console and cold air can create condensation which in turn will short out your console making the situation far worse. Condensation will happen more quickly if your console is overheating due to the greater difference in temperature. In short… **DON’T DO IT**.

### Section 4 is flashing red

- Hardware Failure

The Specific Type of hardware failure can be determined by the error code displayed on the screen.

If the screen is blank or you would like additional information follow the instructions for determining the secondary error code in the section below

- E64: (not yet known)
- E65: DVD Drive Error…. DVD Timeout, Wrong firmware, DVD is without f/w chip, etc.
- E67: Hard Drive Error… It could be a problem with the Hard Drive itself or a problem with the internal connection to the hard drive, Try removing the hard drive and playing without it
- E68: Hard Drive Error… It could be a problem with the Hard Drive itself or a problem with the internal connection to the hard drive, Try removing the hard drive and playing without it, This can also be caused by a Hard Drive Eprom Error.
- E69: Hard Drive Error… It could be a problem with the Hard Drive itself or a problem with the internal connection to the hard drive, Try removing the hard drive and playing without it
- E71: (not yet known)
- E73: (not yet known)
- E74: AV cable error… There is a problem with the AV cable, try using a different AV cable. (could also be a problem with the encoder chip)
- E76: (not yet known)
- E79: Hard Drive Error… It could be a problem with the Hard Drive itself or a problem with the internal connection to the hard drive, Try removing the hard drive and playing without it

## Secondary Error Codes

The specific type of hardware failure can be determined by a “hidden” error code

1. Turn the xbox 360 on, and wait till the 3 red lights are flashing.
1. Press and hold the sync up button (the small white one), while holding that button press the eject button.
1. The LEDs will now blink the first number in the code (as described below).
1. Release the eject button and press it again.
1. The LEDs will now blink the second number of the code.
1. Release the eject button and press it again.
1. The LEDs will now blink the third number of the code.
1. Release the eject button and press it again.
1. The LEDs will now blink the forth number of the code.
1. Release the eject button and press it again.
1. The LEDs will go back to the 3 red flashing lights.

You should be able to determine the difference between the 3 flashing lights and the error code lights by the rate in which they flash.

Here is how you interpret the LEDs to get the code number:

- All four lights flashing - 0
- One light flashing - 1
- Two Lights flashing - 2
- Three lights flashing - 3

Here is what the codes mean:

- 0001 power supply problem
- 0002 power supply problem
- 0003 (not yet known)
- …
- 0010 over heating
- 0011 over heating
- 0012 over heating
- 0013 over heating
- …
- 0020 (Not yet known, possibly overheating)
- 0021 (not yet known)
- 0022 GPU Error / GPU Overheating
- …
- 0101 (not yet known)
- 0102 unknown error - literally means the console does not know what is wrong. Possibly a short or cold solder joint somewhere (2 reports of people repairing this, one was removing moisture build up inside the console, the other used a hot-air rework to re-flow the BGA Ram chips)
- …
- 0110 Memory Error / Memory Overheating
- …
- 1003 Hard Drive Error… It could be a problem with the Hard Drive itself or a problem with the internal connection to the hard drive, Try removing the hard drive and playing without it
- …
- 1010 Hard Drive Error, Can be caused buy a corrupt or missing Eprom.
- …
- 1013 (not yet known)
- …
- 1020 (not yet known)
- …
- 1022 AV cable error… There is a problem with the AV cable, try using a different AV cable. (could also be a problem with the encoder chip)
- …
- 1030 (not yet known)

## Sending in your Console for Repair

If none of the above suggestions work, contact MS customer support get get a support ticket started. If your console is still under warranty DO NOT attempt to open it and fix it yourself. MS will fix it promptly and for free and if you open it you loose the free support.
