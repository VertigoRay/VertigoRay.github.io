This post just serves as quick notes for dissemination  amongst my colleagues.
We recently allowed the Windows 10 1809 update via WSUS -- needless to say, we were a bit hesitant to release round two of this update.
So, we waited until after [the *phased rollout* began on January 16](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history).
Anyway, per the norm, I went to [download RSAT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520) and realized that there wasn't a download available for 1809.

A quick search online revealed that what I learned at [MS Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) 2018 has come to pass.
Microsoft has provided the RSAT tools as part of *Features on Demand* on Windows 10 itself. This will apply to all future Windows 10 releases.
After 1809, upgrades should no longer require that RSAT is re-installed.

# Install RSAT

So, installing can be done via PowerShell or DISM; pick your poison, I've got you covered for both. Regardless, you'll likely want to filter down the capabilities to your actual needs. The commands below will install all of these RSAT capabilities:

- Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.BitLocker.Recovery.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.CertificateServices.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.DHCP.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.Dns.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.FailoverCluster.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.FileServices.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.IPAM.Client.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.LLDP.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.NetworkController.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.NetworkLoadBalancing.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.RemoteAccess.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.RemoteDesktop.Services.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.ServerManager.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.Shielded.VM.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.StorageReplica.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.VolumeActivation.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.WSUS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.StorageMigrationService.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
- Rsat.SystemInsights.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0

## via PowerShell

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ?{ $_.Name -like 'Rsat.*' } | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```

Here's an example of filtering it down to just *ActiveDirectory* and *GroupPolicy*:

```powershell
$rsat = @('ActiveDirectory', 'GroupPolicy')
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ?{ ($_.Name -like 'Rsat.*') -and ($rsat -contains $_.Name.Split('.')[1]) } | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```

## via DISM

```cmd
DISM.exe /Online /add-capability /CapabilityName:Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.BitLocker.Recovery.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.CertificateServices.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.DHCP.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.Dns.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.FailoverCluster.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.FileServices.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.IPAM.Client.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.LLDP.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.NetworkController.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.NetworkLoadBalancing.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.RemoteAccess.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.RemoteDesktop.Services.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.ServerManager.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.Shielded.VM.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.StorageReplica.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.VolumeActivation.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.WSUS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.StorageMigrationService.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.SystemInsights.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
```

To filter this down to just *ActiveDirectory* and *GroupPolicy* just adjust your parameters accordingly:

```cmd
DISM.exe /Online /add-capability /CapabilityName:Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0 /CapabilityName:Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
```

# Errors

## Cannot Download (Error: 0x00F0954)

If you are using WSUS, you may not be configured to download *optional features* from Windows Update (resulting in `cannot download`, or error `0x800F0954`). To resolve this, you will need to [enable Windows Update *Features on Demand* and *Turn Windows Features ON or OFF* in WSUS Environments](https://www.stephenwagner.com/2018/10/08/enable-windows-update-features-on-demand-and-turn-windows-features-on-or-off-in-wsus-environments/).
