> What does it mean to manage/regulate yourself (self-regulate) and others? How does it bring you towards goals? How important is communication in this process and what helps/impedes it?

Self-regulation is concerned with how you control and manage yourself and your emotions, inner resources, and abilities.
It also includes your ability to manage your impulses.
However, based on the the work we're doing in LTEC 5210, I feel like I should talk more about remaining efficient with my time.

# Meaning

When I think about managing others, I think about a common phrase:

> Management is babysitting adults.

Of course, [Sue](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/youre-manager-babysitter-you-want-high-performance-treat-sue-bingham/) might argue with me on this.
All I'm going to say on this point is that you should treat people the way you would want to be treated, until they show you that they can't be treated that way anymore.

Management is really about bringing people together to accomplish a common goal.
Of course, if you're self-managing your get to choose the goals, but I feel like the principle is the same.

# Goals

Goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.
*Yes, I've recently talked with my management about setting SMART goals in our department.*

> Setting goals give you long-term vision and short-term motivation.
> It focuses your studying of knowledge, and helps you to organize your time and your resources so that you can make the most of your life.

*Sounds a lot like management, doesn't it?*
By setting sharp, clearly defined goals, you can measure and take pride in the achievement of those goals.
You'll see forward progress in what might previously have seemed a long pointless grind.
You will also raise your self-confidence, as you recognize your own ability and competence in achieving the goals that you've set.

# Communication

The ability to communicate effectively is one of the most important skills you can hone.
In order to accomplish your goals, you will need to communicate with people.
However, communicating is one of the most feared skills a human possess.
It can take a lot of training to overcome your fears.
