I like to play around a lot with different content management systems, and technology. This is all fine and dandy, but has made me realize that I have a problem ...

I keep relocating my blogs and have thus lost my comments and timeline several times. At this point in time, I figure that I should just pick a host for my blog and leave it alone. This is my attempt at seeing if tumblr will suit my needs. I'll be migrating my old posts over here over the weekend, and we'll see how it flows from there!

Edit (2017 June 21): <a href="http://vertigoray.tumblr.com/post/16191092952/getting-started">I originally posted this on Tumblr</a>, but have decided it's time to move to a real blogging system. Enter: WordPress.
