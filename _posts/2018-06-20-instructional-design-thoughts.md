I often write technical documentation and *readme* files for work that I'm doing.
I often spend as much time, if not more, writing these documents as I spend doing the work.
For example, take a look at the [HiddenPowershell](https://github.com/UNT-CAS/HiddenPowershell) project that I recently published publically.

There are two files in that [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.
One (`README.md`) is the documentation page, and the other (`HiddenPowershell.vbs`) is the actual program.
I don't actually want you to read the `README.md` file.
Just look at the length of it.
If you download it and look at it in an editor you would see that it's 106 lines (74 [sloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)) of text; albeit specially formatted text.
Now, take a look at the `HiddenPowershell.vbs` file.
It is 46 lines (36 [sloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)) long.
Yes, my documentation is about three times longer than my actual code.
That doesn't include [the helper blog article](http://blog.vertigion.com/2018/05/24/gpo-startup-script-practical-download/) that I created for additional information; linked to it from the `README.md`.
It's 210 lines (149 [sloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)) long.
As I said, I'm used to doing a lot of additional work besides just the *real work*.

# Thoughts on Instructional Design

All I've completed so far is the initial design document, and I must say that it is about as monotonous of work as I have ever done.
I'm not saying it's not important.
However, it is very tedious.
I do enjoy the fact that it is a very firm outline of what I need and expect from the training that I am planning.
However, inside the document itself, there is quite a bit of mundane repetition.
I felt like I was just checking things off the list as I was writing the document to completion.

For example, the *learning activties* and the *timeline* sections had almost identical information.
I felt like they could have been combined into one section.
As a matter of fact, simply copied the *learning activties* section and pasted it into the *timeline* section.
I then tweaked a few things; such as adding times and a description.

Overall, I think it's a good exercise to encourage *deep thoughts* on a topic.
However, I don't know how practical this is a framework or template for future endeavors.
I would consolidate some of the repetitive pieces and streamline it a bit.
I'm anxious to see what my peer says about my design document though.
Maybe I have completely missed the mark.
