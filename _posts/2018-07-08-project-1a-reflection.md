After finishing the bulk of the work for [Project A](/2018/06/10/project-1A-description/), I have realized that I did enjoy it.
Initially, [I complained quite a bit about the work that was involved](/2018/06/20/instructional-design-thoughts#thoughts-on-instructional-design).
Although I still believe that some of the work is monotonous, I have better overall standing about why.

This *triptych* is a handy method to deploy when you are going to make a presentation.
However, it doesn't stop at presentations.
When writing long, documentation, it doesn't hurt to leave the same information in a few places.
When it's on the internet, it's a good idea to cross-link to the detailed version of the information.
This is intentional so that things can be more clear to the person reading.
If they don't fully understand what you're talking about, they can click the link and read more; like I did in the first two sentences of this post.
It also allows me, as the designer, to be highly mindful of the relationships across different portions of the process.
It's basically a form of organization and allows the final product to be well thought and purposefully engineered.

My training was intentionally asynchronous because I don't believe that we, as humans, always should be told exactly what to do.
There are more ways than one to skin a cat, and sometimes a journey of discovery is good for the soul.

With that in mind, I'll be implementing the training in the coming week, and plan to update this blog post with how it goes. Unfortunately, we couldn't get things scheduled last week.

*To be continued ...*
