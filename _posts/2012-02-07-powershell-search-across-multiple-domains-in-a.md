<p>While trying to find a quick answer to search across domains for duplicated user accounts, I came across a blog (sourced) that pointed me in a good direction.  To skip the meat of it, we have a Global Catalog setup on our AD and I found it more useful to target that and search the entire forest, then to attach to each domain individually.  I hope this helps others out there in a similar scenario&hellip;<!-- more --></p>

<p>The above code will return you all Domain <em>User</em> Accounts in the Forest with the <em>SamAccountName</em> of <em>user0123</em>.  If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll want to handle the results from <em>FindAll()</em> instead of just dumping it to the pipeline:</p>

<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;ve moved the <em>FindAll()</em> method to the <em>foreach</em> conditional for handling. Of course, I&rsquo;m still dumping the results to pipline, but it&rsquo;s a nice, clean object that is pre-formatted just the way I want it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps others out there!</p>
