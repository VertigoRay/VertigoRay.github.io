<p>I go to UNT (University of North Texas) and one thing that has bugged me is that it always takes me forever to find the settings needed to configure EagleConnect as an Exchange connection from Outlook for a friend.<br /><br /> This is my log of the settings so I know longer need to search endlessly. It is designed to be my notes to myself, but I&rsquo;m publishing so you all can take a look. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll help someone out there.<br /><br /><em>Note: this Exchange connection is hosted by Microsoft (<a href="http://www.outlook.com/">http://www.outlook.com</a>) and functions like an live.com account.<!-- more --></em><br /><br /><strong>Microsoft Exchange server: </strong>BL2PRD0102.mailbox.outlook.com<br /><strong>Username:</strong> <a href="mailto:FirstLast@my.unt.edu">FirstLast@my.unt.edu</a><br /><strong>Use Cached Exchange Mode:</strong> True<br /><br /><em>More Settings should be default</em></p>
